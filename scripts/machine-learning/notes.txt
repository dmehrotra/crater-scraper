CNN - black box that constructus features that we would otherwise have to hand craft. 
these abstract features are so generalized that they account for varience. If we want to train ourselves we need a lot of computing power and time . 

Inception: pretrained css model. trained on google with 100k images....transfer learning, applying learning from a prev training session to a new session.

we feed in images at input at each layer it will perform a series of operations until it ouputs a classification.....each layer is a different set of abstraction...edge detction, shape detection etc...

last layer should be trained on features of craters so it can add a representation to its repository of representations
